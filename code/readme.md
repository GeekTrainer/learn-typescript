## Using the Lab start and end solution files

You can use the TypeScript [Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play), Visual Studio Code, or any TypeScript-compatible IDE to complete the labs in the "Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript" [LINK TO the Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript] learning path.

The **start** and **end** solutions for each lab are located in the **code** folder. In each lab, you will be provided with a link to each folder, as appropriate, for easy access. 

### Setup Visual Studio Code

If you want to use Visual Studio Code to run any of the **start** or **end** solution workspaces in the **code** folder, you must first set up your development environment. 

Install the following software on your machine:

1. Visual Studio Code (or IDE of your choice)
2. Node Package Manager (npm)
3. TypeScript Compiler (tsc)

For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [LINK TO Module 01: Get started with TypeScript ]. After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab solution files in the "Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript" [LINK TO the Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript] learning path.

### Playground

If youâ€™re using the Playground, you can copy and paste the start code from the Lab instructions into the editor. The solution to the lab exercises will be located in the **end** folder in the **module##.ts** file, which you can open in any text editor.
