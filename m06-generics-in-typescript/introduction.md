## Level

- intermediate

## Product(s)

- TypeScript

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with TypeScript functions, interfaces, and classes.

## Summary

Generics are code templates that you can define and reuse throughout your codebase. They provide a way to tell functions, classes, or interfaces what type you want to use when you call it. 

## Learning objectives

1. Identify use cases for generics.
1. Define a generic function.
1. Declare a generic interface.
1. Declare a generic class.
1. Implement generic constraints.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Define generics in TypeScript*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Identify use cases for generics | Identify use cases for generics | Knowledge check | Identify use cases for generics | Yes |
| Define a generic function | Apply generics to functions | Exercise | Define a generic function | Yes |
| Declare a generic interface | Apply generics to interfaces | Knowledge check | Declare a generic interface | Yes |
| Declare a generic class | Apply generics to classes | Exercise | Declare a generic class | Yes |
| Implement generic constraints | Implement generic constraints | Knowledge check | Implement generic constraints | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Generics enable you to create a function, class, or interface that can work with any type that you pass to it, rather than just one. Using generics you can build these components once and reuse them with a variety of types.

1. **Introduction to generics**

    - Explain when to use generics
    - Explain the purpose of type variables
    - Identify scenarios for using multiple type variables

    **Knowledge check**

    - Multiple choice

1. **Using the methods and properties of a generic type**

    - Explain the use of generic constraints to limit types
    - Check the type of a generic variable using a type guard
    
    **Knowledge check**

    - Multiple choice

1. **Exercise: Implement generics with interfaces and classes**

    1. Declare a generic interface
    1. Declare a generic interface as a function type
    1. Declare a generic interface as a class type
    1. Define a generic class

1. **Implement generics with custom types and classes**

    - Declare a generic with custom types and classes
    - Using generic constraints with custom types and classes

1. **Lab**

    1. Exercise 1: Declare a class using a generic 

1. **Summary**

    Generics serve a specific purpose in the definition of interfaces, classes, and functions and are not suitable in every scenario, but they can be a powerful addition to your coding toolkit.
