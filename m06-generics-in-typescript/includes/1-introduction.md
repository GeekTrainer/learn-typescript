While generics are supported by many programming languages, including TypeScript, they are not currently available in JavaScript. So, for some JavaScript coders, generics are a mystery. Now that you're well on your way to being a TypeScript coder, let's unlock the mysteries of generics and add these useful tools to your programming toolkit.

In this module, you will:

- Identify use cases for generics.
- Define a generic function.
- Declare a generic interface.
- Declare a generic class.
- Implement generic constraints.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify use cases for generics.
- Define a generic function.
- Declare a generic interface.
- Declare a generic class.
- Implement generic constraints.
