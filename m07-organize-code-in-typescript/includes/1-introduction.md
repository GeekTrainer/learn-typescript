TypeScript provides two ways to organize code: Namespaces and modules. While both provide a way to categorize related code in meaningful ways and help you control which code is exposed to the global namespace of your applications, there are some differences between them.

In this module, you will:

- Implement single-file namespaces.
- Implement multi-file namespaces.
- Implement a module.
- Explain the design considerations for using namespaces and modules.
