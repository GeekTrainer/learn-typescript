If you know how to write functions in JavaScript, you know how to write functions in TypeScript. But TypeScript adds some new capabilities to the standard JavaScript functions to make them easier to work with.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the benefits of using types in functions.
- Write functions that have required, optional, default, and rest parameters.
- Define function types using type aliases or interfaces.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with functions and arrays in JavaScript
- Installed software:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - TypeScript - TypeScript can be installed after installing Node.js after running the following in a terminal or command window:

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [LINK TO Module 01: Get started with TypeScript ]. After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab setup or solution files in the "Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript" [LINK TO the Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript] learning path.
