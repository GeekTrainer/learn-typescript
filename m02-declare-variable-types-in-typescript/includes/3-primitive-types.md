Let's start by reviewing the most basic and common types you might encounter when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code. These will later form the core building blocks of more complex types.

## Boolean type

The most basic datatype is the `true` or `false` value, known as a boolean.

For example:

```typescript
let flag: boolean;
let yes = true;
let no = false;
```

## Number and BigInteger types

As in JavaScript, all numbers in TypeScript are either floating point values or BigIntegers. These floating-point numbers get the type `number`, while BigIntegers get the type `bigint`. In addition to hexadecimal and decimal literals, TypeScript also supports binary and octal literals introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

For example:

```typescript
let x: number;
let y = 0;
let z: number = 123.456;
let big: bigint = 100n;
```

## String type

The `string` keyword represents sequences of characters stored as Unicode UTF-16 code units. Like JavaScript, TypeScript also uses double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`) to surround string data.

Some examples:

```typescript
let s: string;
let empty = "";
let abc = 'abc';
```

In TypeScript, you can also use template strings, which can span multiple lines and have embedded expressions. These strings are surrounded by the backtick/backquote ( \` ) character, and embedded expressions are of the form `${ expr }`.

For example:

```typescript
let firstName: string = "Mateo";
let sentence: string = `My name is ${firstName}.
    I am new to TypeScript.`;
console.log(sentence);
```

This example produces the output:

```console
My name is Mateo.
    I am new to TypeScript.
```

## The void, null, and undefined types

JavaScript and TypeScript have two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: `null` and `undefined`. These types are most useful in the context of functions, so we'll discuss them in more detail in a later module.
