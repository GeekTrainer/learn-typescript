## Summary

TypeScript provides two ways to organize you code: Namespaces and modules. While both provide a way to categorize related code in meaningful ways and help you control which code is exposed to the global namespace of your applications, there are some differences between them. This module introduces you to modules in TypeScript (referred to as external modules in previous versions.) 

In addition to modules, you can import other external libraries containing type definitions that you can take advantage of in your code.

## Learning objectives

1. Organize code using modules.
1. Import an external type library.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Working with external libraries in TypeScript*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Organize code using modules | Organize code using modules | Exercise | Organize code using modules | No - Combine **Organize coding using modules*, *Exercise: Export and import module components**, and **Exercise: Compile modules** |
| Import an external type library | Import an external type library | Exercise | Import an external type library | Yes |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice:

    *Add your scenario [(Scenario guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-scenarios)*

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

    **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*

    - Question type
    - Question type

1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?
