TypeScript provides two ways to organize code: Namespaces and modules. This module explains how to organize TypeScript code using namespaces. While both namespaces and modules provide a way to categorize related code in meaningful ways and help you control which code is exposed to the global namespace of your applications, there are some differences between them.

## Learning objectives

- Explain the purpose of namespaces.
- Implement single-file namespaces.
- Implement multi-file namespaces.
- Explain the design considerations for using namespaces and modules.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Installed software:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - TypeScript - TypeScript can be installed after installing Node.js after running the following in a terminal or command window:

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [LINK TO Module 01: Get started with TypeScript ]. After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab setup or solution files in the "Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript" [LINK TO the Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript] learning path.
