# Title

Implement interfaces in TypeScript

## Role(s)

- student
- developer

## Level

- intermediate

## Product(s)

- TypeScript

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with functions and arrays in JavaScript
- Installed software:
  - Git
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Node.js
  - TypeScript

## Summary

JavaScript doesn't support interfaces so, as a JavaScript developer, you may or may not have experience with them. In TypeScript, you can use interfaces as you would in traditional object-oriented programming. You can also use interfaces to define object types and this is the primary focus of this module.

## Learning objectives

1. Explain the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript.
1. Declare and instantiate an interface.
1. Extend an interface.
1. Declare an interface with custom array types.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Explain the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript | Using interfaces to define object types | Knowledge check | Explain the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript | Yes |
| Declare and instantiate an interface | Using interfaces to define object types | Exercise | Declare and instantiate an interface | Yes |
| Extend an interface | Using interfaces to define object types | Exercise | Extend an interface | Yes |
| Declare an interface with custom array types | Using interfaces to define object types | Knowledge check | Declare an interface with custom array types | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You can use interfaces to describe an object, naming and parameterizing the object's types, and to compose existing named object types into new ones.

1. **Introduction to interfaces in TypeScript**

    - Explain the purpose of an interface
    - Identify the reasons for using an interface
    - Explain how an interface is different from a type alias

    **Knowledge check**

    - Multiple choice

1. **Exercise - Declare and instantiate an interface**

    1. Declare an interface
    1. Implement an interface in a function

1. **Exercise - Extend an interface**

    1. Extend an interface
    1. Implement an extended interface in a function

1. **Other ways to use interfaces**

    - Create indexable types
    - Describe a JavaScript API using an interface

    **Knowledge check**

    - Multiple choice

1. **Lab**

    1. Exercise 1: Declare the interfaces
    1. Exercise 2: Implement the interfaces

1. **Summary**

    Interfaces can be used to define the shape of an object, not only for functions, but also for classes and other object types. Now that you know the fundamentals of declaring interfaces, you can apply it to these other object types.

- See the [TypeScript Handbook: Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) for more information about interfaces.
