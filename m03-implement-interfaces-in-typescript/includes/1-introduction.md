JavaScript doesn't support interfaces so, as a JavaScript developer, you may or may not have experience with them. In TypeScript, you can use interfaces as you would in traditional object-oriented programming. You can also use interfaces to define object types and this is the primary focus of this module.

In this module, you will:

- Explain the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript.

- Declare an interface.

- Implement an interface.

- Declare an interface with custom array types.
