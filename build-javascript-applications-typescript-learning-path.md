## Summary

In this learning path, you’ll learn the fundamentals of building JavaScript applications using TypeScript.

## Short description
TypeScript offers all the features of JavaScript, plus an additional layer on top of these: The TypeScript type system. 

In this learning path, you’ll learn how using TypeScript for JavaScript development can help you build more robust code, reduce runtime type errors, take advantage of modern features before they are available in JavaScript, and work better with development teams.

After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
- Set up a TypeScript development environment.
- Declare variable types.
- Implement interfaces.
- Develop typed functions.
- Declare and instantiate classes.
- Apply generic types to functions, interfaces, and classes.
- Work with external libraries.
- Organize TypeScript code using namespaces and modules.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with basic HTML and JavaScript ES6/2015, including:
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Scope
- Arrays
- Loops
- Iterators
