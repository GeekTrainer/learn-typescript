## Summary

TypeScript offers all the features of JavaScript, plus an additional layer on top of these: The TypeScript type system. In this learning path, youâ€™ll learn how using TypeScript for JavaScript development can help you build more robust code, reduce runtime type errors, take advantage of modern features before they are available in JavaScript, and work better with development teams.

## Learning objectives

1. Set up a TypeScript development environment.
2. Declare variable types.
3. Implement interfaces.
4. Develop typed functions.
5. Declare and instantiate classes.
6. Apply generic types to functions, interfaces, and classes.
7. Work with external libraries.
8. Organize TypeScript code using namespaces and modules.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
