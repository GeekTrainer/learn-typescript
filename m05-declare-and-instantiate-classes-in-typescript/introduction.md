## Summary

Classes in TypeScript extend the ES6 functionality by adding TypeScript-specific features like type annotations for class members, access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. Another benefit of using TypeScript is that you can use it to develop with classes and then compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, as needed.

## Learning objectives

1. Explain how you can use TypeScript classes describe the shape of objects. 
1. Declare a class using TypeScript.
1. Instantiate a class using TypeScript.
1. Apply access modifiers to a class.
1. Define static properties in a class.
1. Declare a class that extends another class.
1. Declare an interface to ensure class shape.
1. Determine when to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Declare and instantiate classes in TypeScript*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Explain how you can use TypeScript classes describe the shape of objects | Explain the benefits of using classes in TypeScript | Knowledge check | Explain how you can use TypeScript classes describe the shape of objects | Yes |
| Declare a class using TypeScript | Using additional features of TypeScript | Exercise | Declare a class using TypeScript | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Classes enable you to express common object-oriented patterns in a standard way, making features like inheritance more readable and interoperable. In TypeScript, classes are yet are another way to define the shape of an object, in addition to describing object types with interfaces and functions.

1. **Introduction to classes in TypeScript**

    - Describe the components of a class
      - Properties
      - Methods
      - Constructor
      - Accessors
