- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with TypeScript functions and interfaces.

## Summary

Classes in TypeScript extend the ES6 functionality by adding TypeScript-specific features like type annotations for class members, access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. Another benefit of using TypeScript is that you can use it to develop with classes and then compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, as needed.

## Learning objectives

1. Explain how you can use TypeScript classes describe the shape of objects. 
1. Declare a class using TypeScript.
1. Instantiate a class using TypeScript.
1. Apply access modifiers to a class.
1. Define static properties in a class.
1. Declare a class that extends another class.
1. Declare an interface to ensure class shape.
1. Determine when to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object.

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Classes enable you to express common object-oriented patterns in a standard way, making features like inheritance more readable and interoperable. In TypeScript, classes are yet are another way to define the shape of an object, in addition to describing object types with interfaces and functions.

1. **Introduction to classes in TypeScript**

    - Describe the components of a class
      - Properties
      - Methods
      - Constructor
      - Accessors

    **Knowledge check**

    - Mutliple choice

1. **Exercise - Create a class**

    1. Create a class using the class keyword
    1. Declare the class properties
    1. Define the class constructor
    1. Define the class accessors
    1. Define the class methods

1. **Exercise - Instantiate a class**

    1. Instantiate a class using the new keyword

1. **Access modifiers**

    - Explain the difference between public, private, and protected access modifiers
    - Explain the purpose of the readonly access modifier

    **Knowledge check**

    - Mutliple choice

1. **Exercise - Apply access modifiers to a class**

    1. Apply the private access modifier to class properties

1. **Define static properties**

    - Explain the difference between instance properties and static properties
    - Apply the static keyword to a property

1. **Extend a class using inheritance**

    - Explain how inheritance can establish relationships between classes
    - Identify the difference between the base class and a subclass
    - Explain the purpose of a method override

1. **Exercise - Extend a class**

    1. Extend a class to create a new class that inherits its properties
    1. Override a method in a subclass

1. **Exercise - Declare an interface to ensure class shape**

    1. Define an interface that describes the properties and methods of a class
    1. Implement the interface in a class definition

1. **Design considerations**

    - Identify reasons for using an interface
    - Identify reasons for using a class
    - Determine when to use an interface or a class in code

1. **Lab**

    1. Exercise 1: Convert three TypeScript functions to a class definition
    
1. **Summary**

    While newer versions of JavaScript support classes, you can define TypeScript classes that have additional features that make you code more robust, less error prone, and easier to develop.
