As a JavaScript programmer, you may have experience with classes, or the pre-[ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) (ES6) implementation based on constructors and prototypes. JavaScript classes in ES6 are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScriptâ€™s existing prototype-based inheritance.

Classes in TypeScript extend the ES6 functionality by adding TypeScript-specific features like type annotations for class members, access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. Another benefit of using TypeScript is that you can use it to develop with classes and then compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, as needed.

In this module, you will:

- Declare and instantiate a class using TypeScript.

- Declare a class that inherits the properties of another class.

- Utilize function overloads and overrides.
