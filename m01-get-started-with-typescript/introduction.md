1. **Introduction**

    Every JavaScript project is subject to the same limitations with regard to type checking. TypeScript is able to overcome this limitation, making it the ideal choice for any project that requires JavaScript.

1. **Overview of TypeScript**

    - Define TypeScript
    - Explain TypeScript compatiblity with JavaScript
    - Explain the typical migration path from JavaScript to TypeScript

    **Knowledge check**
    - Mutliple choice

1. **Exercise: Select a TypeScript Editor**

    1. Open the TypeScript Playground
    1. Select an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports TypeScript
    1. Install Visual Studio Code

1. **Exercise: Install the TypeScript compiler**

    1. Test your TypeScript installation
    1. Install Node Package Manager (npm)
    1. Install TypeScript

1. **Compile a TypeScript file**

    - Explain how the compiler transforms TypeScript code to JavaScript
    - Identify the compiler options

    **Knowledge check**
    - Mutliple choice

1. **Exercise: Set up a TypeScript project**

    1. Setup a new TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code
    1. Generate a tsconfig.json file
    1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
    1. Add an HTML file to test the JavaScript code

1. **Summary**

    By setting up a development environment for TypeScript, you are now ready to learn more about it and use it with your JavaScript coding projects.

## Notes

- Watch this video of [Anders Hejlsberg of Microsoft introducing TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThlMt_raWyk). This video is slightly out of date and but provides a great overview of the "why" behind TypeScript from the person who developed it.
- Go to the [TypeScript site](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to find the TypeScript documentation and other resources.
- Go to the [TypeScript repository on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) to contribute to the TypeScript open source community.
- Go to [TypeScript Tutorials: Migrating from JavaScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/migrating-from-javascript.html) to learn more about migrating your existing JavaScript projects to TypeScript.
- Go to [Visual Studio Code â€“ TypeScript tutorial in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-tutorial) to learn more about using TypeScript in Visual Studio Code.
